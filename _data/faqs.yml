- title: What if I want to participate but can't dedicate the entire day Saturday and half the day Sunday?
  description: >-
    <p>For those who want to show their support and also participate in a meaningful way
    but who can't commit to the entire weekend, we have coordinated a shorter, low-level event
    with partner <a href="http://www.liveoakpl.org/">Live Oaks Public Library</a> on Bull Street,
    just a short walk from Bull Street Labs, to hold a community-wide "Wiki-thon" from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.
    Saturday Oct. 21. Participants will be collaboratively building a mapped "local wiki" of locality
    knowledge. To sign up for the Wikithon, fill out <a href="https://pydisaup.paperform.co/">this short
    form.</a></p>

- title: What if I don't own a laptop?
  description: >-
    <p>If you don't have a laptop and would like to borrow one to use for the Hackathon, shoot an email
    to <a href="mailto:yall@opensavannah.org">yall@opensavannah.org</a> no later than Oct. 16.
    We will make every best effort to procure for you a loaner computer to use.

- title: What are my transportation and/or parking options for the Hackathon?
  description: >-
    <p>Bull Street Labs is located in the Starland District of midtown Savannah. If taking public transit,
    the closest bus routes include the 4 Line, which stops at Barnard and 38th Streets, and either the 14 or
    the 11 lines, both of which stop at Abercorn and 38th Street (one block away).</p> <p>If driving,
    be sure not to park in the lot directly opposite the building, as that is a private lot. Generally,
    there will be plenty of street parking available that no street cleaning will take place on during the weekend,
    and you should have little trouble finding a spot near the location.</p>

- title: Is there an age requirement?
  description: >-
    <p>Absolutely not! We do require that all participants under the age of 21, however,
    allow organizers to place a bracelet on their arm during the reception denoting their underage status.

- title: What if I'm not confident enough in my coding/design skills?
  description: >-
    <p>You have <em>absolutely</em> nothing to fear, and only knowledge to gain from participating
    in the hackathon. No one starts out in this world as a programming whiz; each of us has to learn somewhow.
    If you don't form a team ahead of time, we will make sure to place you with teammates with complimentary
    levels of technology acumen, pairing up new coders with professional developers and assigning dedicated
    Team Mentors to assist in the learning process.</p> <p>Open Savannah aims to create a safe space for
    participants of all skill levels, sexes, races, creeds, political beliefs, sexual orientation and gender
    orientation. If you fear at any point that anyone in the hackathon is 'looking down on you' or not valuing
    what you have to contribute because of your skillset or because of any other reason, be certain to consult
    our <a href="https://opensavannah.org/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and report <strong>any and all</strong>
    potential violations to the Core Leadership team by emailing <a href="mailto:yall@opensavannah.org">yall@opensavannah.org</a>.
    The report will be dealt with in a swift, discrete and professional manner.</p>
